    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log('age:', age, 'age2:', age2);
    age = 200; //age is reassigned, but age2 is still assigned original age as it hasn't been reassigned
    console.log('age:', age, 'age2:', age2);
    

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Morgan', 'Aoife', 'Matt', 'Mandy']
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players;

    console.log('players:', players);
    console.log('team:', team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
           // team[3] = 'Tony';
    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
      
    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // OR create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    console.log('team2:', team2);
    console.log('team3:', team3);
    // OR use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];  //spreads original 'players' into new array 'team4 '
    //OR
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Morgan Costigan',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person; //references, does not copy
    captain.number = 1;
    console.log('person:', person);
    console.log('captain:', captain);
    
    // how do we take a copy instead?
      const person2 = {
        name: 'Duke Garwood',
        age: 80
      };

      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person2, {number: 77}); //assigns original 'person2' values AND new values, in this case 'number' to new object, in this case 'cap2'
      console.log('person2:', person2);
      console.log('cap2:', cap2);

    //can also reassign values during object.assign
      const person3 = {
        name: 'Lil Jonnie Malkovich',
        age: 55
      };

      const cap3 = Object.assign({}, person3, { shoeColor: 'red' , age: 33 }); //assigoriginal 'person2' values AND new values, in this case 'number' new object, in this case 'cap2'
      console.log('person3:', person3);
      console.log('cap3:', cap3);
      
      

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
